# about-my-repositories
Small description about my repositories.

The repositories are just limited samples of what I have created using programming languages. Those examples may include websites, cellular applications, and examples of object-oriented programming. As I have time to work on github on my free time, I will add more of my work that has been completed in the past and potential future projects. I plan to work as a freelance web developer on the side of my full-time job. I plan to utilize this platform to showcase other websites I am building for small businesses and start-up companies.

My practice code for building websites through Free Code Camp can be found at https://codepen.io/michael_henry
